# Forward Workitems

This method looks for existing workflow workitems for a business object (for example BUS2009 => Purchase Requisition Item).

The task filter in this instance is populated from the Fiori configuration for purchase requisitions - however you can manually add worflow
task ids to filter by (eg TS*), or leave blank.

If workitems exist it will forward them to the new approver.
